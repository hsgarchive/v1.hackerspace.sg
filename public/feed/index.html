			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When geeks get hungry simply cooking an egg will never do. We have to apply technology and learn what is the best temperature for denaturation of proteins. Naturally a regular fried egg will never do. Poached eggs are much cooler and require a bit of manual dexterity and timing. Traditionally trained chefs learn this through lots of practice and <span>heuristics. Heuristics</span> will, of course, never do. Far too imprecise. We've got to get precise temperature control and use modern materials and technology to make the process more easily reproducable. So here goes:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Get a fairly deep pot, a heat source controlled by a PID controller accurate to +/- 1 degree F, a timer (preferably a timer app on your android phone of course), plastic wrap, string, cup, olive oil, an oil brush, water, and um... something else. Oh yes - an egg! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Put the water into the pot at least 3 inches deep.</p>
<p>2. Set your PID temperature to 175F and apply heat letting the temperature <span>stabilize.</span></p>
<p>3. Tear off a square of plastic wrap and spread olive oil on one side fairly liberally with the oil brush. If you fail to oil the plastic your egg will stick when you try to put it onto your serving dish which isn't a pleasant sight.</p>
<p>4. Set the plastic wrap atop the cup pushing it into the indentation.</p>
<p>5. Break the egg and carefully pour its contents into the cup.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="332" src="http://www.notyourdemographic.com/static/media/uploads/Photography/Food/GeekChef/PoachedEgg/DSC06345-1024x.jpg" width="500"></p>
<p>6. Tie up the plastic wrap with the string.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="400" src="http://www.notyourdemographic.com/static/media/uploads/Photography/Food/GeekChef/PoachedEgg/DSC06346-1024y.jpg" width="266"></p>
<p>6. Set the timer to 3 minutes then drop the egg into the water bath to cook.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="332" src="http://www.notyourdemographic.com/static/media/uploads/Photography/Food/GeekChef/PoachedEgg/DSC06348-1024x.jpg" width="500"></p>
<p>7. When the timer expires bring the egg out and immediate serve it atop whatever dish you have prepared for it.</p>
<p>8. Finally - put your camera battery into the charger cause you forgot to charge it the night before and can no longer take pictures of the end result.... er... sorry. Next time proper food porn. Trust me it tasted yummy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span><span><span>When you find yourself awake at O-dark thirty in the morning working on the mystical incantations required to get <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/" >varnish</a>, the veritable duct-tape that caches the internet and makes your app seem performant, to do yet another </span></span></span><span><span><span>unbelievably</span></span></span><span><span><span> cool thing no one ever </span></span></span><span><span><span>anticipated</span></span></span><span><span><span> it should do - the sight of the sun coming up behind the curtains reminds you that you haven't eaten in a while. Having been traveling the last few weeks and too busy to catch up on grocery shopping I don't even have eggs to poach <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/05/sous-vide-101-slow-cooked-eggs.html" >(sous-vide</a> of course). Getting dressed and riding the motorcycle out to breakfast will surely break my </span></span></span><span><span><span>rhythm</span></span></span><span><span><span> and destroy my productivity.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Fortunately for me (in this situation) I happen to reside in Bangkok where I can take advantage of some benefits of cheap labor and the low fixed cost of living. No - not programmers - you pay for talent no matter where you go. But home delivery is dirt cheap and quick! So it's dial 1711 and get McDonald's delivery on the line at 6:30a. Two bacon egg and cheese McMuffins to your door in 25 minutes runs you THB 150 (USD $4.88) including generous tip and doesn't interrupt your stride.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Now if only there was some specialty low-carb food delivery I'd be set. Yum. Back to coding...</span></span></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p lang="zxx">I've built twenty-something plus development groups over my career. These experiences often provided emperical support for the generalization that Asians are particularly smart people – and a few prominant counter-examples as well but let's not dwell on that right now. So why is it, since there are so dang many asians who are particularly smart and like doing geeky smart stuff, that there are no innovative software companies that were created by Asians in Asia and impacting the rest of the world in a positive way? Where is the Asian Bell Labs, Microsoft, Oracle? I can't name a single example. Europe's got SAP and a few others. What gives, Asia?? This question never really bothered me or came up until I came face to face with having to justify "Why America" – and found it wanting.</p>
<p lang="zxx"> </p>
<p lang="zxx">A few years after <a class="internal" href="http://www.notyourdemographic.com/accidental-entrepreneur/" >accidentally launching my first business</a>, I stumbled head first into the contractor/consulting business. I was the guy who would get called in when a big project was failed or failing and people's jobs were on the line. Good work for a single guy who can travel with little notice. Clients thought they were paying me to salvage and deliver a working first release of their major new product, but, in reality I spent the vast majority of my time structuring and building the team and getting the right process, technologies, and supporting infrastructures in place. So at the end of my contract when I ride off into the sunset with a completed system, the client is also left with a functioning team that helped build this product and could take it forward. They were again in control of their own destiny. Only a few ever figured out that THIS was the biggest value I delivered and more than I like to think managed to squander that investment and go back to bad habits. Horse, meet water. (Sigh)</p>
<p lang="zxx"> </p>
<p lang="zxx">So in the course of doing this I built up a cadre of other great developers and consultants that I would call in to help on projects. A particular pair were my close friends and now married with children couple from Bangalore, Vaidhy and Usha. I met Vaidhy while working as a systems architect at an R&amp;D group funded by a large Scandanavian Telecom company right when the boom was getting underway in 1998. He applied for a position as a C++ dev even though he only really had experience doing C style work for a very large firm in Atlanta. Now we were doing bleeding edge C++ stuff and combining it with Smalltalk, Perl, and Tk and gods know what else our boss, Ed, would run across. But it was fun, cool, and truly innovative stuff.</p>
<p lang="zxx"> </p>
<p lang="zxx">During my interview with Vaidhy it was clear he didn't have the experience but I have a knack at identifying potential and knew he'd make good in 3 or 4 months. About maybe 6 weeks later he was already past where I'd hoped he'd be for the year. I'd like to think my amazing C++ architecture talents sped that process along but clearly I had found a very talented guy. His wife, Usha, later wrapped up her Masters degree and I ended up giving her her first job (post boom) at the security firm I was CTO which she took on and handled extremely well given she had no prior experience doing web services. Let's just say their daughter shows every sign of ruling the universe and I made sure to place my bid for an arranged marriage before she was born. See – I REALLY know potential.</p>
<p lang="zxx"> </p>
<p lang="zxx">After 9/11, things changed for America. And it wasn't the terrorists that did it. America changed itself. The Patriot Act was a giant mess of bad laws that had been rejected many times by Congressmen who had some understanding of the meaning behind our Constitution. That was all pushed aside to respond to the "threat". What no foreign enemy was ever able to do we managed to do to ourselves by putting so many poison pills into law and destroying the very thing that makes America unique and great and competitive.</p>
<p lang="zxx"> </p>
<p lang="zxx">One of the more spiteful and stupid responses was to suddenly make it much more difficult for incredibly talented people like Vaidhy and Usha remain in America. The hassles they had to put up with to renew visas were absurd and required leaving the country and re-applying for things resulting in short trips to Mexico and Canada with legitimate concerns that the may not be allowed to return. I experienced this distress myself when returning from Canada as tour manager for a female Japanese punk band from the UK (honest!) with a Vietnamese-American (I presumed) model that we picked up to assist while in New York. When we pulled the van through customs and upon hearing the request that everyone who is not a US citizen please raise their hands – I did a double take as her hand went up! She'd lived in America since she was two years old and had known no other country in her life. She had her NY drivers license but not her green card or passport and had never bothered to get citizenship. The US customs agent (a young asian male actually who seemed quite jealous) threatened to detain and deport her to Vietnam! Finally an older more reasonable gentleman stepped in after I started making plans to rebook the end of our tour and let her back in and us on our way to make more rock and roll history in Detroit – but that's another story. That was 2005. Now you cannot go in and out of Canada from the United States without a passport. Insane.</p>
<p lang="zxx"> </p>
<p lang="zxx">One day Vaidhy and Usha said they had had enough. "We can live like kings in Bangalore and not put up with this nonsense. Why stay in America?" Why America indeed? I had no answer which I found compelling so I got us contracts elsewhere. During one of these we discussed what was different about what we were doing and whether it could be done in Asia. Why weren't there Asian companies doing cool stuff? The answer ultimately came down to opportunity and exposure – or the self imposed lack thereof.</p>
<p lang="zxx"> </p>
<p lang="zxx">In every Asian country the education system points the best and brightest to do well on their national exam. The top kids go to the top university. The top grads of the top universities get jobs straight away in the top tech firms. There, these potential geniuses will learn whatever technology their company has selected – either C# or Java. They will soon master what is needed to perform their particular assignments well. So well in fact that, after two or three years, they will be promoted to manager and manage 20 other kids just like they were – and never write another line of code again!</p>
<p lang="zxx"> </p>
<p lang="zxx">So Asia's filled with potential starved for exposure. There are no technical career paths in Asia. Your value is determined by how many people answer to you, not by what technical capabilities you bring to bear for your company. So this spelled opportunity to me. After seeing so much of my value to my clients go to waste because of corporate politics, determining that there was a huge untapped source of geeks yearning to be geeks – I decided that I would go build a world class dev group my way and do innovative technology in Asia with Asians just to prove it could be done.</p>
<p lang="zxx"> </p>
<p lang="zxx">I've been here six years now and am quite satisfied that I've made my point. The whole business model is spelled out on my <a class="internal" href="http://proteus-tech.com/concept/othershore/observations/" >company website</a> so I won't repeat it here but I hope everyone will steal it and run with it cause I'm ready for phase II and need there to be more talented dev groups happening to take advantage of it. Indeed I sponsored the very first Barcamps in Thailand for this very purpose.</p>
<p lang="zxx"> </p>
<p lang="zxx">And that's how the second incarnation of Proteus Technologies came about in Asia. The story of the first incarnation is far sillier... one day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="western">I wasn't always this suave hip twenty-first century tech entrepreneur that you understandably envision I must be. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;Before I discovered that I actually enjoyed the business of business, I was a hard core tech nerd. I knew nothing about what it takes to run a business, why anyone would want to go through the trouble, or what possible reason anyone would want to buy any of this tech stuff outside of the obvious fact that it's really fun and cool.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">My first "real" computer job was as the computer tech at Dawn Computer Support in my little home town of 70 some odd thousand people in Arkansas – technically the 2nd largest city. We built and sold clones of IBM PC/XT/AT computers and provided on-site service (me) to various small businesses. I was still in high school and it was a massive improvement over sacking groceries at Safeway which I had been doing (and hating) heretofore. Besides, now I was getting $4 per hour rather than the $3.75 Safeway paid and didn't have union reps chasing me around to join their communist revolution to ensure no one being paid under $7 an hour was allowed to cut the watermelons in the produce section (true story)!</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">One evening there was no one else on the floor and a lady comes in looking to buy a printer. My mind races at all the possible options that must be considered in this very important decision about what to recommend to her but I had absolutely no context for what someone like her may want to do with a printer. I naturally froze and stumbled my way through until she regrettably went on her way sans printer. Had she wisely asked about which printer supported downloadable fonts from the pfs:Write word processor and stated a preference for a serial connection rather than parallel then I would have been on game and made the sale! I had no business being in sales and avoided being anywhere near the floor again after that.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Quite satisfied with being the tech guy I went through a few more jobs and even did freelance programming until I landed a gig that paid $7 per hour doing dBase/Foxbase programming for a small consulting shop. This was when PC networks and companies like Novell were just becoming viable. So a lot of our business was customizing SBT Software accounting modules for small companies and downsizing from from insanely expensive mainframe/mini computers to DOS-based PC networks. Fun work and really helped the clients out a lot. PC revolution indeed! I was on the front lines.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">We were also a very small company. Paul (not his real name), the extremely smart chain smoking owner who loved to golf was a good programmer and had grown the biz to include a secretary, salesman, another programmer, Ray, (who just came from the mainframe world and found PCs quite chaotic), and myself. Being so small, and PC servers being so expensive (not uncommon to be $20,000 1988 dollars), our clients had to pay for hardware upfront so we could get the stuff setup and working in our office before deploying to their site. We'd done enough of these that our vendor let us pay COD check – which meant, technically we were "cash on delivery" but we could just hand the UPS driver a check and they trusted us that it would be good.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Working on our biggest project to date, Paul calls in and says he's sick. We're very busy but wrapping up and things seem ok so I assure him that we're fine so just get himself well for the install and we'll be ready for him. A few days later the secretary gets a call from our network hardware vendor telling us that the check for these servers bounced! This is, of course, impossible as our client paid us up front and she deposited it to our account herself. Unfortunately none of us has access to the bank account to even check the balance so we scramble to contact Paul who cannot be found. 48 hours later, concerned he was dead or something, I broke into his apartment (leet pick locking hacker skills!) but he was not there either and everything seemed in place. Now we're really in a fix. Server company wants their money, client wants their servers, we got payroll coming in a few days which comes outta the same checking account that we're told is empty and Paul is AWOL.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">One of my (several) unusual 'personality'(?) characteristics is that I seem incapable of worrying about things that I have determined I really have no further ability to influence. Often it makes me appear insensitive to others' plights or concerns – like poor Ray who can't stop imagining what terrible things must be happening. The upside is that I never panic and thrive in tense situations. (cue RepoMan quote!) This is way above my pay grade so I just try to convince him that we should just keep on working to get the system ready for delivery and expect an answer will come soon. He doesn't buy it but manages to keep going regardless.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">And, indeed, answers come in strange ways. In this case, in the form of a half-inch thick American Express bill that shows up in the mail. Our secretary opens it at my insistence, "Paul usually opens these himself!" she protests. "It's huge, he's missing, it's normally just a couple of pages! Open it!" Hidden within are page after page of cash advances from Las Vegas. We soon hear from his brother that, apparently Paul (unbeknownst to us) has an old alcohol problem, was going through a messy divorce, and blew the whole company on a drunken binge to Vegas. So now there's no money in the company and we're not getting paid. The sales man and Ray quit while mumbling something about the insane PC world and how we was going back to mainframes forever. (At the time, I thought to myself “what an idiot cause PCs were the future” but hope he finally made his fortune and got his revenge working on the Y2K problem. Not the last time someone likely succeeded doing something I thought was insanely stupid and therefore have given up trying to know what's best for others – even when it's clearly stupid.) Now I'm the only one left to call the client and let him know his servers are about to be collected by the UPS man.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">The client's a nice guy. He understands how to talk to tech geeks like myself (and Paul) and get things done. So I feel REALLY bad to have to break this news to him. I ring him on the phone, give him the punch line and brace for the inevitable screaming. Instead, what I hear emanating from the phone's speaker I'm holding a few inches from my ear, is a soft – mono-tone – calm disbelief "Oh no.... not again." Seriously?!?!? WTF?!?!? I am incredulous!</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">It turns out that Paul and the client go way back. Way back apparently to when this exact same thing happened before! I am stunned that our client would expose himself to such risk again but, we do live in the South, and people really are nicer there – as I will depend on soon enough myself. Now I'm unemployed, broke, and can forget about saving money to go back to school. My parents think I'll never leave home. Paul's out of business and off at rehab to dry out. But there are all these other clients who still need someone to look after their systems and seemed to notice that our business improved after I was hired so some credit rubbed off on me. A few suggested that they should sign support contracts with me ("What's a support contract?" is my first question!) and I took these to First National Bank and got a 20,000 business loan.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">April 1st, 1989, Business Data Management was born (no joke – I still have my planner entry). I have 400 square feet divided into two offices and a massive 330MB hard drive I paid $1600 for installed in my Compaq Deskpro – and no idea how to run a business. But I do have plenty of work and nice clients – many of them small accounting firms who know better than I just how clueless I am. So I code and work all nighters (I perfected the 36 hour work day. Work 24 straight, sleep 12. Do this twice in a row and you're back on normal people time.) I suck at budgeting and remembering how/when to pay certain bills and government fees. More than a few times I sheepishly ask a client whether it would be possible to pay the next quarter's support contract in advance. Certainly if not for the kindness (or perhaps outright desperation – but I think mostly kindness) of others, I would have been out of business many times over.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">But eventually I got it. I don't think had I lived in NY or California that I would have had so many chances to learn and would likely have ended up going back to regular employment. But I finally discovered (after making several proposals and closing a few sales) that the business of business could (almost) be as fun as executing code at times. Especially when you discover that your awareness of an elegant technical solution solves a customer's real problem in a particularly disruptive way that excites them (once you convince them it's real). I can think of no more objective appreciation of the value of an idea than convincing someone who has no idea of how it's done to give you significant sums of money to do it because they understand what it does for them. That's fun stuff. And that's how I became an accidental entrepreneur.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s with product being named as fruits? Apple, Blackberry and now a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry</a>. I&#8217;ve been following the development of the Raspberry&#8217;Pi since it hit the inter-webs. The concept was really great. An open source low cost ($25) ARM based board which runs some flavor of linux. Targeted for education, it provided an affordable computer which students/kids could use to start experiencing computing, electronics and start programming easily. But the best part was response from the public. Basically what the originators <a href="http://vr-zone.com/articles/rs-components-previews-raspberry-pi-in-singapore/15684.html">expected to be a few hundred units order became a few hundred thousand units</a>. Everyone loved the concept and of course the price point. One could say that the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child">One Laptop per Child</a>&#8221; premise could be finally fulfilled by this.</p>
<p><a href="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7599.jpg"  rel="lightbox"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1081" title="DSC_7599" src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7599-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>But I digress, the wide-spread interest in this board both from software hackers (it <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Distributions">runs Linux</a> and python out of the box) and hardware hackers (it has some <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Hardware">12 GPIO pins doing SPI, I²C, UART, etc</a>) sparked communities all around the world. In Singapore we had our own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/raspberrypisingapore/">&#8220;Raspberry&#8217;Pi &amp; Co Singapore&#8221; Facebook group</a>. What started off as a place to compare where to order a Raspberry&#8217;Pi and when who&#8217;s gonna get their board when, became a nice community sharing ideas, tips and tricks. There were discussions about everything from various Linux distros and libraries to use on the Raspberry&#8217;Pi to builds, mods, cases and even alternative hardware platforms to play with while everyone waited anxiously for the Pi.</p>
<p>When the boards finally shipped to the lucky few individuals, a meetup was proposed to share ideas, and also give those without a &#8216;Pi board a chance to touch and feel the boards themselves. Thanks to our dear friend at <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">Hackerspace</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/miccheng">Michael Cheng</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/changcj">CJ</a>, the meetup was held there. Members of the community who had the boards were encouraged to bring them down and do a &#8220;Show and Tell&#8221; session on what they were doing with their Pi and what they planned to do with it.</p>
<p><a href="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7608.jpg" rel="lightbox[1073]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1086" title="DSC_7608" src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7608-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>On the last day, we found out about the <a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk">Raspberry Jams</a>. These basically are community events, similar to the one we were going to organize, happening in a few places in the UK and around the world. In support of our brethren, our event was changed from just a meetup to Raspberry Jam.</p>
<p>To start off the session we watched a <a href="http://fora.tv/2012/05/19/Maker_Movement_Heads_to_the_Classroom_with_Raspberry_Pi">video of a panel at the recent Maker::Faire Bay Area</a> featuring <a href="http://raspberrypi.org/about">Eben Upton</a> the founder of the Raspberry&#8217;Pi, <a href="http://revision3.com/tbhs">Ben Heck</a>, <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/author/makemattr/">Matt Richardson from MAKE</a> magazine about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Maker movement in the classroom</span>.</p>
<p><a href="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7583.jpg" rel="lightbox[1073]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1076" title="DSC_7583" src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7583-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>Following that we had two great sessions from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mike.veltman">Mike Veltman</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/calvin.cheng.lc">Calvin Cheng</a>. Mike explained the various versions of Linux he played with to get a stable setup. Once he had that he setup his &#8216;Pi as a home media server, as well as a reverse proxy server. He has 5TB worth of storage attached to the &#8216;Pi, and with a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/minidlna/">miniDLNA</a> running on it, he could stream his media to DLNA players on his mobile devices. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse proxy</a> allowed him to tunnel and access websites which were banned in some countries he was visiting. And finally, the small form factor of the &#8216;Pi helped with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_acceptance_factor">Spousal Acceptance Factor (SAF)</a> something that geeks all over the world have to deal with.</p>
<p><a href="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7586.jpg" rel="lightbox[1073]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1078" title="DSC_7586" src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7586-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>Calvin Cheng had something else up his sleeve. He unveiled his new project, <a href="http://littlehackers.com">littlehackers</a>. He is looking at building a batch (like 10) of Raspberry&#8217;Pi based small portable computers to teach young children programing. He has been sourcing for small portable displays for that build as well as getting education software like <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> running on his Pi.</p>
<p><a href="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7607.jpg" rel="lightbox[1073]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1085" title="DSC_7607" src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7607-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>Afterwards there was a long discussion on the hardware itself and things one could do attach to it and many project ideas. The &#8216;Pi promises to a great enabler for all sorts of geeks, and the excitement was obvious in the attendees. For the members who hadn&#8217;t seen a Raspberry&#8217;Pi they got look at the board for themselves. For the rest, many ideas were exchanged. Overall it was a great meetup.</p>
<p><a href="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7604.jpg" rel="lightbox[1073]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1083" title="DSC_7604" src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_7604-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>The next Raspberry&#8217;Pi Jam Singapore is being planned for a September/October time frame so most people would have gotten their hands on the &#8216;Pi boards and played around with things to share more.</p>

<p>This class is proving so popular that we're now doing it almost every other week! Check out the full-house - Zul came in to help teach otherwise it might have dragged on a bit longer than 3 hours!</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.sgbotic.com/">SGBotic</a>, sponsors of the Arduino kit, we've been attracting new attendees for Dave's highly rated Arduino workshops. We've had to limit class sizes to about 12 due to the number of kits available as well as to offer individual attention to all attendees, but we're defintiely looking to do more workshops at the beginner as well as more advanced levels. In fact, at least one attendee has gone on to build a fantastic electronically controlled camera rig. If you'd like to see it, join us at Hackerspace.SG Saturday 7th July 4pm at <a href="http://www.hackerspace.sg/">Hackerspace.SG</a> fora show and tell. We'll also be hosting the NUS HCI Lab which has plenty of cool electronics projects to inspire you!</p>
<p>Everything is provided in the class, but you'll need to bring your own laptop. No experience is necessary for the Intro level classes, and if you'd like to practice afterwards everything can be purchased from <a href="http://www.sgbotic.com/">SGBotic</a>.</p>
<p>See our previous&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.curica.com/tag/electronics">Arduino posts</a>&nbsp;for information on the curriculum.</p>

<p>Michael continues the PHP Web Intro class in the 2nd of 3 classes. This is the second series, fully attended as of session 2. Not much new to say here, but Michael's definitely better at pacing now that he's done 5 full sessions.</p>
<p>If there's continued demand we might ask him to do an Intermediate level class soon.</p>

<p>The second series of the "Introduction to Web Programming with PHP" workshops is back at Hackerspace!</p>
<p>Following positive feedback from the previous series, Michael Cheng of the PHP User Group began a second round of his PHP Web Programming workshops targetted at attendees with no prior knowledge of any sort of programming.</p>
<p>The material continues to be the same, tweaked slightly in delivery based on past feedback. The time the class was completely full with 14 participants, including a business which sent it's employees to expand their skillset.</p>
<p>Within 2 hours the class was able to create PHP scripts to interact and process user input, including the upload of files. Followup classes (there are 3 in the series, this was the first) will expand on that and teach participants to upload the webpages to hosting providers.</p>
<p>Michael will be conducting these again if there's demand, visit the <a href="http://www.curica.com/class_events/intro-to-web-programming-with-php-lesson-1--2">class page on Curica</a> and post a note if you'd like to attend or be notified if there's space in future classes.</p>

<p style="">We've become pretty well-known for Arduino workshops, and Dave Appleton continues to amaze us with new content and fantastic hardware.</p>
<p style="">This time it's LCDs and Keypads in an Intermediate level workshop. This brought back a few familiar faces who've been through the previous Introductory and Intermediate sessions, but also 2 new participants with no prior experience. These guys enjoyed the session so much that they've decided to come along for the next Introductory session on the 29th, in reverse order. We like to think of this as flexibility in casual learning. :)</p>
<p style="">During the 3 hour workshop subtitled "Talking to your Arduino", Dave helped the class hook up LCD character displays and keypads to their Arduino kits, enabling input and output using various libraries. Towards the end of the class that he managed to get a beautiful graphic LCD going as well, along with a quick demonstration on how it might be hooked up and used in place of the character LCD screens.</p>
</p>
<p style="">If you'd like to join in the fun, check <a href="http://www.curica.com/">curica.com</a> for the <a href="http://www.curica.com/class_events/control-things-with-the-arduino-yet-again">upcoming Introductory workshop</a> on the 29th of June.</p>

<p>Fish and vegetable farming indoors on a sunny Saturday afternoon? Only with Aquaponics!</p>
<p>Stephan February conducted and introductory workshop on Aquaponics, which is sustainable food production using waste from aquaculture to grow plants/vegetables with hydroponics. In just over 2 hours, Stephan went through the basics of hydroponic gardening, aquaculture basics (or simply keeping fish), the aquaponic cycle, kit requirements, setup and even a demo!</p>
<p>Along with his useful tips on what to buy and where to buy them, the workshop learnt how to build a bell siphon pump, required to regulate the draining of water from the hydroponics system. Other practical highlights of the demo were examples of the material needed, such as hydroton growing media (for the plans) and various aquatic essentials like electric pumps and pH meters.</p>
<p>Check out the photos as the 4 participants got involved in building a basic system! Though there was no space (or time!) to keep the demo system and establish a live eco-system with fish and plants, the workshop left with enough knowledge to build a complete working system and start experimenting at home.</p>
