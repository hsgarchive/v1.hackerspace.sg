<p>Our regular scheduled reserved time for our members to get anything done is back to Mondays.

<p><strong>Show and Tell: 3 Young Indie Film-makers</strong><br />
Fri, Jan 29 6:30 pm Fri, Jan 29 9:30 pm</p>
<p>Today, we welcome 3 young Indie film-makers to showcase what they have been working on for the past 1 year. Lincoln, Teck Siang and Michael will be screening 3 films from their portfolios, all festival awarding winning pieces, followed by Q&amp;A session. It&#8217;s open to all hackerspace regulars, vagabonds and passerbys. Just anyone interested to know a little bit more about the local independent film scene&#8230; from the perspective of these 3 younglings. Be creative, be critical, and support our independents!</p>
<p><strong>The Weekend</strong><br />
Sat, Jan 30 6:30 pm Sat, Jan 30 9:30 pm</p>
<p>This idea started on NYE 2009 when the guys and gals were sitting in HackerspaceSG, high on beer and bouncing ideas off the wall. The problem we are facing now is that bloggers doesn&#8217;t know what the PR folks wants and the PR folks doesn&#8217;t know what the bloggers want. So to solve this problem, we decided to have this networking session where people from social media meet together and discuss on how they can work together better. Since we can&#8217;t think of a better name, we decided to call it &#8220;The Weekend&#8221;.</p>

Sat, Jan 23 2:00 pm Sat, Jan 23 5:00 pm</p>
<p>All HackerspaceSG Members needs to RSVP to sg.humanism.meetup@gmail.com. Mainstream values, mainstream culture, mainstream population. In the past few years, the word &#8220;mainstream&#8221; has been bandied about in our mass media, on a wide range of issues such as &#8220;family values&#8221;, &#8220;global warming&#8221; and &#8220;death penalty&#8221;. But what are they referring to, exactly? Do they refer to the values or opinions held by the majority of our population? Or those few who are most vocal and persuasive? How do we know if these values are right or rational? Whose mainstream is it, anyway? Although consensus may be hard to reach, come to this month&#8217;s SHM and have a fun-filled afternoon discussing in small groups a range of issues from varying perspectives. </p>
<p>Meetup etiquette : Participants come from different backgrounds and with different age and experience. Still, every individual deserves dignity and respect and therefore I urge participants to observe strictly our meeting etiquette.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hope everyone had a great holidays last week. This week we don&#8217;t have any events except our usual hack time as usual on Mondays.</p>
<p><strong>Hackerspace Hack Time</strong><br />
Mon, Dec 28 6:00 pm Tue, Dec 28 12:00 am</p>
<p>Our regular scheduled reserved time for our members to get anything done is back on Monday again. We currently have the following projects being worked on &#8211; Security Access System, Sucktionator, Water Rocket, Stop Motion Animation, and many other miscellaneous projects currently worked on by our members. So come join in and hack on any of your projects!</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Since there isn&#8217;t anything much to report, I&#8217;ll like to take this chance to write about how the events process is like.</p>
<p>As of this writing, this is the process of getting an event or a meetup into <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">hackerspacesg</a>. It will evolve over time as the place grows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the calendar at <a href="http://www.hackerspace.sg/calendar">http://www.hackerspace.sg/calendar</a> to see if the date and time of your event is available.</li>
<li>Send an email to <a href="email://eventsAThackerspaceDOTsg">events AT hackerspace DOT sg</a> with the date and time and details of your event. Any additional details will be much appreciated.</li>
<li>Indicate whether if your event is open to public, or private. Indicate whether your event is free, or there&#8217;s an entrance fee.</li>
<li>If any answers are the latter (private or paid), then there will be a need to discuss rental fees before approving. If both answers are the former (public and free), then it will go ahead to the approval process.</li>
<li>The events coordinator for hackerspacesg will evaluate the event and gather more information if required in order to build a supporting case to host the event.</li>
<li>The event will then be posted on both calendar and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hackerspacesg">google groups</a> for our members to object. Silence means consent. Monitor this thread in case there are any objections.</li>
<li>After a few days (a week maximum), if there are no objections, the event is approved. If there are, the event will be rejected based on the reasons discussed and you will be informed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some guidelines to help convince people at <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">hackerspacesg</a> not to object to your event. These guidelines do not indicate that the event will be approved even though it fulfils all these points, but it will help greatly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The event is community focused (e.g. user groups).</li>
<li>The event is about learning, sharing, thinking out of the box, creativity, etc.</li>
<li>The event is in-line with what <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">hackerspacesg</a> is all about.</li>
</ul>
<p>It might seem like a tedious process, but do not worry because the events coordinator will be doing most of the work.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had an awesome Christmas party last Friday, and we&#8217;d like to thank everyone for coming and we hope you enjoyed yourself. This week&#8217;s is a little slow because of Christmas and the New Year, but I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be back with more events in January.</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder to everyone. If you want to host any community meetup which is open to public at <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">HackerspaceSG</a>, send an email to events A-T hackerspace D-T sg. We&#8217;re happy to have you at our humble house. So without further ado, here are the events for the week.</p>
<p><strong>Hackerspace Hack Time</strong><br />
Mon, Dec 21 6:00 pm Tue, Dec 22 12:00 am</p>
<p>Our regular scheduled reserved time for our members to get anything done is back on Monday again. We currently have the following projects being worked on &#8211; Security Access System, Sucktionator, Water Rocket, Stop Motion Animation, and many other miscellaneous projects currently worked on by our members. So come join in and hack on any of your projects!</p>
<p><strong>CodeAndroid Christmas Party / Hackfest</strong><br />
Sat, Dec 26 1:00 pm Sat, Dec 26 5:00 pm</p>
<p>Another Christmas Party?!? Yes, that&#8217;s right. But this time we&#8217;re not the host. CodeAndroid is having a chill out session at HackerspaceSG with no agenda except to talk, discuss, and have some fun. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=200048289155">RSVP here</a> if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry guys, but this is a super last minute event from HackerspaceSG which we just got word from <a href="http://www.monochrom.at/english/">Johannes Grenzfurthner</a> yesterday night of his intention to rant with us about his experience with context hacking.</p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the rant: it is a tradition of performance art which was developed in Europe in the 19th century and successfully ported to the Internet in the early-to-mid 1990s. It is now being introduced to Asia by aesthetic pioneers like Johannes Grenzfurthner.</p>
<p>In recognition of Singapore&#8217;s leading position as the financial and cultural capital of Asia, and of <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">Hackerspace.SG</a> as the leading hackerspace in Singapore, he has chosen<a href="http://hackerspace.sg">Hackerspace.SG</a> as the venue for his first Singapore performance of this artwork.</p>
<p>We invite all members of <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">Hackerspace.SG</a> and the related community to attend this rant.</p>
<p>There is no fee, though we wish to thank in advance all the wonderful people who consume beer, wine, or soft drinks, for their cash donations into the little glass that says &#8220;your donations are welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the purposes of licensing under Chapter 257 Section 319, this is an exempt entertainment as defined by the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Specified Arts Entertainment) (Exemption) Order 2005.</p>
<p>Details follow.</p>
<p>monochrom and the East: Some stories about Context Hacking and Asia<br />
A tour-de-farce by Johannes Grenzfurthner of <a href="http://www.monochrom.at/english">monochrom</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.monochrom.at/english">monochrom</a> is a worldwide operating collective dealing with technology, art and philosophy and was founded in 1993. So to sum up, monochrom is an unpeculiar mixture of proto-aesthetic fringe work, pop attitude, subcultural science, political activism and technological disaster.</p>
<p>Johannes wants to tell us stories about monochrom&#8217;s &#8220;context hacking&#8221; projects that specifically deal with our focus on contemporary Asian topics.</p>
<p>The term context hacking—like its mimetic sibling “communication guerrilla”—refers to unconventional forms of communication and/or intervention in more conventional processes of communication. Context hacking is a specific style of political action that observes and makes visible the paradoxes and absurdities of power. Context hacking uses absurdities as the starting point for interventions by playing with representations and identities, with alienation and over-identification.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had a great time over the weekend at <a href="http://neotenylabs.com/nsc1/">Neoteny Singapore Camp 1</a> and everyone was very excited about <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">HackerspaceSG</a>. Apparently everyone who attended NSC1 are all hackers themselves and don&#8217;t want to leave our <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">HackerspaceSG</a>. So here are the events of this week.</p>
<p><strong>Make cool things with Mitch Altman</strong><br />
Mon, Dec 14 6:00 pm to Late</p>
<p>Wow! Did I mention people don&#8217;t want to leave <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">HackerspaceSG</a>? Well, you shouldn&#8217;t! Because one of the founders of <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge">Noisebridge</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman">Mitch Altman</a>, is in the house! Yes, you heard me. He&#8217;ll be teaching us how to make awesomely cool things with micro-controllers! YES! If you&#8217;re one of those interested, you&#8217;ll be learning from the man himself. Come! Join us for this experience of a lifetime. There will be kits available for purchase on the spot. They are all priced in SGD.</p>
<p>LED Cubes, TV-B-Gone,Brain Machines, Drawdio, Mini POVs  ( $30 each )<br />
Trippy RGB lights ( $15 )<br />
Boarduino &#8211; $30<br />
AVR Programming Boards &#8211; $30</p>
<p>Check out <a style="color: #2a5db0;" href="http://www.ladyada.net/make" target="_blank">http://www.ladyada.net/make</a> or <a style="color: #2a5db0;" href="http://www.tvbgone.com/cfe_mfaire.php" target="_blank">http://www.tvbgone.com/cfe_mfaire.php</a> if you&#8217;re unsure what the above are. But I&#8217;m sure you already know where to look for information.</p>
<p><strong>Pivotal Labs Seminar on Next-Generation Software Engineering with Ruby and other languages</strong><br />
Mon, Dec 14 7:30 pm Mon, Dec 14 11:00 pm</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not interested with micro-controllers and robots, you might be interested in some software engineering. We have <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a>, software ninja SWAT team of the Internet, joining us to share their valuable knowledge with us. They are the guys who saved <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>. Yes, that&#8217;s right, the famous <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> that everyone uses. They are in town for NSC1 and would like to meet the local community of developers to talk about software engineering best practices, agile development methodologies, and scaling Ruby. If you think of yourself as the Tiger Woods (sans drama) of software development, or would like to one day be one of the best, join us. If you think of yourself as a CMM Level 0 up-all-night rebel superhero, this session may inspire you to realize your potential through discipline &#8230; kind of like a self-taught street punk going to train under kung fu masters at Shao Lin. Just join us! No registration required.</p>
<p><strong>Hackerspace Hack Time</strong><br />
Tue, Dec 15 6:00 pm Wed, Dec 15 12:00 am</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve moved our Hack Time from Monday to Tuesday this week simply because we have too many awesome people in our home who are excited to share and discuss with us. So after learning all that cool robotic micro-controller mayhem, together with your ninja software engineering skills, why don&#8217;t cool off by working on your own projects? We have reserved this day just for you.</p>
<p><strong>Hackerspace.SG Christmas Party</strong><br />
Fri, Dec 18 7:00 pm Fri, Dec 18 11:30 pm</p>
<p>Jingle bells, jingle bells. Yes, we&#8217;ve survived our first month of <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">HackerspaceSG</a> without a celebration of our very own <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=219542641712">Christmas Party</a>. If you have always been thinking of popping by HackerspaceSG to see the space itself, this party will be a great time to do so. You don&#8217;t really have to RSVP, but sometimes it is always good to know who might be coming. Post your suggestions on how we can do this. I hope to do a PotLuck Style with people bringing food, together with some basic catered food. Plus our usual drinks, beer, wine and alcohol in the house. As usual, we hope you can contribute to our pot of donations. I&#8217;ll see all of you there at the party!</p>
<p><strong>Hacking Sexual Morality Through The Ages</strong><br />
Sat, Dec 19 19:30 Sat, Dec 19 22:30</p>
<p>If our own Christmas party hasn&#8217;t gotten you worn out yet,  you can join us again next evening for a meeting on sexual morality.</p>
<p>So we all know that Religions tell their faithful: No fornication, no adultery, no anal sex, no oral sex, no homosexuality, no pants, no short skirts, etc. Secular humanists however have no prescribed text to follow, no holy men to guide us in the finer points of dating and sex. Does this imply a no holds barred approach? How should Humanists navigate the minefields of love and lust? How should Humanists manage relationships with people of faith?</p>
