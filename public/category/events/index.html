<p><strong>The Weekend</strong><br />
Sat, Jan 30 6:30 pm Sat, Jan 30 9:30 pm</p>
<p>This idea started on NYE 2009 when the guys and gals were sitting in HackerspaceSG, high on beer and bouncing ideas off the wall. The problem we are facing now is that bloggers doesn&#8217;t know what the PR folks wants and the PR folks doesn&#8217;t know what the bloggers want. So to solve this problem, we decided to have this networking session where people from social media meet together and discuss on how they can work together better. Since we can&#8217;t think of a better name, we decided to call it &#8220;The Weekend&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Singapore Humanism Meetup (RSVP required)</strong><br />
Sat, Jan 23 2:00 pm Sat, Jan 23 5:00 pm</p>
<p>All HackerspaceSG Members needs to RSVP to sg.humanism.meetup@gmail.com. Mainstream values, mainstream culture, mainstream population. In the past few years, the word &#8220;mainstream&#8221; has been bandied about in our mass media, on a wide range of issues such as &#8220;family values&#8221;, &#8220;global warming&#8221; and &#8220;death penalty&#8221;. But what are they referring to, exactly? Do they refer to the values or opinions held by the majority of our population? Or those few who are most vocal and persuasive? How do we know if these values are right or rational? Whose mainstream is it, anyway? Although consensus may be hard to reach, come to this month&#8217;s SHM and have a fun-filled afternoon discussing in small groups a range of issues from varying perspectives. </p>
<p>Meetup etiquette : Participants come from different backgrounds and with different age and experience. Still, every individual deserves dignity and respect and therefore I urge participants to observe strictly our meeting etiquette.</p>

<p><strong>Hackerspace Hack Time</strong><br />
Mon, Dec 28 6:00 pm Tue, Dec 28 12:00 am</p>
<p>Our regular scheduled reserved time for our members to get anything done is back on Monday again. We currently have the following projects being worked on &#8211; Security Access System, Sucktionator, Water Rocket, Stop Motion Animation, and many other miscellaneous projects currently worked on by our members. So come join in and hack on any of your projects!</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Since there isn&#8217;t anything much to report, I&#8217;ll like to take this chance to write about how the events process is like.</p>
<p>As of this writing, this is the process of getting an event or a meetup into <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">hackerspacesg</a>. It will evolve over time as the place grows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the calendar at <a href="http://www.hackerspace.sg/calendar">http://www.hackerspace.sg/calendar</a> to see if the date and time of your event is available.</li>
<li>Send an email to <a href="email://eventsAThackerspaceDOTsg">events AT hackerspace DOT sg</a> with the date and time and details of your event. Any additional details will be much appreciated.</li>
<li>Indicate whether if your event is open to public, or private. Indicate whether your event is free, or there&#8217;s an entrance fee.</li>
<li>If any answers are the latter (private or paid), then there will be a need to discuss rental fees before approving. If both answers are the former (public and free), then it will go ahead to the approval process.</li>
<li>The events coordinator for hackerspacesg will evaluate the event and gather more information if required in order to build a supporting case to host the event.</li>
<li>The event will then be posted on both calendar and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hackerspacesg">google groups</a> for our members to object. Silence means consent. Monitor this thread in case there are any objections.</li>
<li>After a few days (a week maximum), if there are no objections, the event is approved. If there are, the event will be rejected based on the reasons discussed and you will be informed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some guidelines to help convince people at <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">hackerspacesg</a> not to object to your event. These guidelines do not indicate that the event will be approved even though it fulfils all these points, but it will help greatly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The event is community focused (e.g. user groups).</li>
<li>The event is about learning, sharing, thinking out of the box, creativity, etc.</li>
<li>The event is in-line with what <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">hackerspacesg</a> is all about.</li>
</ul>
<p>It might seem like a tedious process, but do not worry because the events coordinator will be doing most of the work.</p>

This week&#8217;s is a little slow because of Christmas and the New Year, but I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be back with more events in January.</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder to everyone. If you want to host any community meetup which is open to public at <a href="http://hackerspace.sg">HackerspaceSG</a>, send an email to events A-T hackerspace D-T sg. We&#8217;re happy to have you at our humble house. So without further ado, here are the events for the week.</p>
